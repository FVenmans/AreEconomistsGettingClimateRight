This repository contains data and code to replicate the numerical simulations in: Dietz, Simon, Frederick van der Ploeg, Armon Rezai, and Frank Venmans. "Are economists getting climate dynamics right and does it matter?" Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists 8, no. 5 (2021): 895-921.

To replicate Figures 1, 3 and 4, open and run file "Fig1_3_4.m" in MATLAB. File "FigA1A2A3.m" will replicate the variations on Figure 1 contained in Appendix A.

To replicate Figure 2 and/or the analyses in Appendix E, you need to run "Fig2AppendixE.m".

The file "Appendix_D_DICE2016_FAIR_exact_SSP.gms" contains the GAMS code for the DICE model with FAIR climate dynamics.

For questions related to the figures, please contact f.venmans1@lse.ac.uk, and for questions related to the GAMS code you can contact armon.rezai@wu.ac.at.
