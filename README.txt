Dear user,
This repository contains data and code to make graphs of "Are Economists getting climate dynamics right and does it matter".
To make figures 1, 3 and 4, open file "Fig1_3_4.m" in matlab. Change the path on the second line of code to the path where you have downloaded al the other files. Run the code.
Same for file "Fig2AppendixE.m" and "FigA1A2A3.m". 
For questions regarding figures with runs from the DICE model, please contact Armon Rezai. 
If there is a file missing, please let me know via f.venmans1@lse.ac.uk.
Best,
Frank
