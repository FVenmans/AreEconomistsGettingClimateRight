Dear user,
This repository contains data and code for the paper "Are Economists getting climate dynamics right and does it matter" in JAERE 2021.
To make figures 1, 3 and 4, open file "Fig1_3_4.m" in matlab. Change the path on the second line of code to the path where you have downloaded al the other files. Run the code. Same for file "Fig2AppendixE.m" and "FigA1A2A3.m". 
The file "Appendix_D_DICE2016_FAIR_exact_SSP.gms" contains the GAMS code for the DICE model with FAIR climate dynamics.
For questions related to the figures, please contact f.venmans1@lse.ac.uk, and for questions related to the GAMS code you can contact armon.rezai@wu.ac.at.
Best,
The authors
